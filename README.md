## Implementation
[PubSub Implementation](https://github.com/pedroaston/contentpubsub) - implemented in golang (repo still private)

## Evaluation
[testground plan](https://github.com/pedroaston/contentps-test) - repo that contains all test plans used in testground to evaluate the pubsub (repo still private)

## NOTES
I will leave here the performance results from testground, as well the dissertation and presentation of my thesis in the future. I'm currently fixing minor issues, and on the next weeks i will try to scale up the number of nodes i'm using. Once both my repository become stable i will turn them public.
